- always save cache = outdir
    - even if run aborts (for debugging)
    - add a state flag
- save cache in a date based directory
- also add support for a per-host pidfile
- allow user to specify cache dir - to give
  full flexibility
- drop context - it is a very small unecessary wrapper
    - maye introduce cdist.log instead!
- replace out_path with out_base
    - directory under which all the subdirectories are
      created
      -> by default ~/.cdist/run
      -> out_base_path
- drop support for deprecated environment variables
    __cdist_out_dir
    __cdist_remote_out_dir
